## üìå Overview

In this phase, I deploy a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine in Microsoft Azure, which will serve as on-premises domain controller. This is the foundational step toward establishing a hybrid identity environment using Microsoft Entra ID. The VM will later be configured with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and synced with the cloud using Azure AD Connect.

---

## üéØ Objectives

* Provision a Windows Server 2022 VM using the Azure Portal
* Configure networking to allow secure RDP access
* Prepare the environment for domain promotion and AD Connect setup

## üß† Key Concepts Reinforced

| Concept                | Description                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Entra ID     | Cloud-based identity platform replacing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) |
| Hybrid Identity        | Identity model bridging on-prem AD with Microsoft Entra ID                |
| Domain Controller (DC) | Central server managing Active Directory user accounts and authentication |
| RDP                    | Remote Desktop Protocol used to connect to the VM                         |
| Azure Portal           | GUI interface to manage and deploy Azure resources                        |

## üß∞ Lab Environment & Tools

* **Azure Portal** ([https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com))
* **Windows Server 2022 Datacenter ‚Äì Azure Edition (Gen2)**
* **Remote Desktop Connection (RDP)**
* **Resource Group:** `HybridIdentityLab-RG`
* **Virtual Machine:** `HybridLab-DC`

---

## üîß Tasks Performed

1. Logged into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Created a new VM using:

   * Windows Server 2022 Datacenter Gen2 image
   * Standard\_B1s size (upgraded to D2s\_v3)
   * Enabled RDP (port 3389) for remote access
3. Configured default networking and disk options
4. Deployed VM into new resource group: `HybridIdentityLab-RG`
5. Prepared VM for Active Directory Domain Services installation in the next phase

---

## üìà Outcome Summary

A secure and accessible Windows Server 2022 VM named `HybridLab-DC` was successfully deployed in Azure. This VM will serve as the domain controller for the hybrid identity lab and is ready for domain configuration and role installation.

---

## üè¢ Business Relevance

Deploying a domain controller in Azure reflects real-world hybrid environments where organizations maintain legacy on-prem identity systems while extending control and visibility to cloud identity services. This setup is essential for:

* Transitioning from legacy IT infrastructure to modern cloud identity
* Supporting hybrid workforces with secure access to cloud and on-prem apps
* Ensuring seamless SSO and conditional access policies via Entra ID
* Enabling password writeback, group synchronization, and identity governance
